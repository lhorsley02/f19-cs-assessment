Explanation:
    The main pattern is that the smaller the array, the less time it takes. 
In the arrays tinyArray and smallArray, the insert time decreases, while with
the other larger arrays, the insert time increases each time. 

    The reason insert is generally slower is because when insert is used, it 
adds the new element to the front of the array, and all other elements in the array 
have to increase their index by one. That whole process slows down the runtime
as a whole.
